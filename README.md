# Smart-Home-Automation

Smart-Home-Automation project propose a low cost and user friendly remote controlled home
automation system. Modern houses are gradually shifting from conventional switches to
centralized control system, involving remote controlled switches. Presently, conventional
wall switches located in different parts of the house makes it difficult for the user to go near
them to operate. Even more it becomes more difficult for the elderly or physically
handicapped people to do so. Remote controlled home automation system provides a most
modern solution with smart phones. The web server is simultaneously updated by sensing the
status of the things which are connected to the network. The status of the appliances is
controlled by the switch it either ON or OFF using the computer technology. It also provides
the security, energy efficient , and ease of use, hence it is adopted more. It also helps by
providing to control and monitoring on web browser.
This application includes Google assistant along with Adafruit server and IFTTT
service and the NodeMCU microcontroller as the major components along with a relay
board. Natural language voice is used to give commands to the Google Assistant.All of the
components are connected over the internet using Wi-Fi which puts this system under the
IoT. The devices in IOT is used for controlling or nominating the devices where all of them
are far away from this. MQTT and TCP protocols are also used to implement the ESP8266
Wi-Fi module. The potential IOT applications develop the environment that covers all
together the applications, command, control and routing process and security of the node and
system. All the IOT devices include various objects like personal computer, smart phones,
tablets, which gives the communication between the things and people and also the things
between them . To reduce the need for the home intervention, we are used to control the
home automation through the use of control systems. The device ESP8266, which is the
embedded device used to access the cloud. The range is limited by using the Bluetooth
device. The devices are controlled by the telephone and with PIC controlling remote device
by Hasan . The IOT devices uses different types of protocol. MQTT (Message Queuing
Telemetry Transport) is one of the useful and advance. Because it is easy to implement, open,
lightweight, low bandwidth protocol. Modern systems generally consists of switches and
sensors connected to a central hub called a gateway from which the system is controlled with
a user interface that is interacted either with a mobile phone software ,tablet, computers or a
web interface ,often but not always via internet cloud services. Unlike most of available
home automation system in the market the proposed system is scalable that one server can
manage many hardware interface modules as long as it exists on Wi-Fi network coverage.
System supports a wide range of home automation devices like power management
components, and security components.
Google assistant is AI (Artificial Intelligence) based voice command service. Using
voice, we can interact with google assistant and it can search on the internet, schedule events,
set alarms,control appliances, etc. This service is available on smartphones and Google Home
devices. We can control smart home devices including lights, switches, fans and thermostats
using our Google Assistant.
Home automation technologies are required to be cost effective, user friendly, easy to
install and flexible with various network infrastructure and appliances. An intelligent
personal assistant is capable of organizing and maintaining information. Some personal
assistants have the ability to provide information based on voice inputs or commands.
