You can create your own commands for your Google Assistant using IFTTT. See services and devices you can control.

IFTTT is a separate company from Google. The name stands for "If this, then that." 

For example, if you say:

    "It’s time to wake up," then your automated coffee maker turns on
    "Tell my friends I'm going sailing," then a status update is posted to your social network

Together, your custom phrase and action is called an Applet. To create an IFTTT Applet or use ones that other people have created, follow the steps below.
